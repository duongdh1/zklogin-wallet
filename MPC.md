To build an MPC (Multi-Party Computation) 2-of-3 escrow wallet solution on Sui employing zkLogin, you'll need to combine several components: a Sui Move smart contract for the escrow logic, zkLogin for seamless user authentication and transaction signing, and an MPC threshold signature scheme for secure, distributed key management and approval. This setup allows for a trustless escrow where funds are held until 2 out of 3 parties (e.g., buyer, seller, and an arbiter) approve the release, with users logging in via familiar OAuth providers (like Google or Apple) without managing traditional private keys.

Note that Sui natively supports multisig (with threshold weights, e.g., for 2-of-3), but true MPC uses distributed computation to generate a single signature without reconstructing the full private key. For MPC, you'll implement off-chain threshold signing (e.g., using Ed25519-compatible libraries) while the on-chain address appears as a standard single-signature address.
